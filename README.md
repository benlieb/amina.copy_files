# Installation
This script is basically just one ruby file that that will be executed from the command line.  It reads a data file that contains the necessary info to copy files from and to the right place. 

This doesn't need to be "installed" per se, but it does need to be copied to your computer. I recommend copying this whole project to your computer so you can see it in action, and mimic the setup anywhere you need to use this. We should probably be on Google hangouts screenshare when you "install".

## Installation: Option 1
If you can navigate in your terminal to a place where you want to install these files, do that and run 

    git clone git@github.com:pixelterra/amina.copy_files.git
